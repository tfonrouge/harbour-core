      <cStringToMatch>    is the substring scanned for
      <cString>           is the scanned string
      [<nCounter>]        determines how many occurrences are of
                          <cStringToMatch> in <cString> are searched
                          Default: search last occurrence
      [<nIgnore>]         determines how many character from the start
                          should be ignored in the search
                          Default: 0
   $RETURNS$
      <cRestString>       the portion of <cString> after the <nCounter>th
                          occurrence of <cStringToMatch> in <cString>
                          If such a rest does not exist, an empty string
                          is returned.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function scans <cString> for <cStringToMatch>. After the
      <nCounter>th match (or the last one, depending on the value of
      <nCounter>) has been found, the portion of
      <cString> after that match will be returned. If there aren't enough
      matches or the last match is identical to the end of <cString>, an
      empty string will be returned.
      After a match has been found, the function continues to scan after
      that match if the CSetAtMupa() switch is turned off, with the
      second character of the matched substring otherwise.
      The function will also consider the settings of SetAtLike().
